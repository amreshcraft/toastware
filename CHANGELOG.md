## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added
* Global Toast API (toaster object):
You can now trigger toasts globally without using the `useToast()` hook.
Simply import toaster and call methods like:
```js
toaster.success("Data saved!");
toaster.error("Something went wrong!");
toaster.addToast("Custom message", "info", "top-left");
```
* Promise-Based Toasts:
Added support for `toaster.promise()` to handle async feedback states.
```js
toaster.promise(fetchData(), {
  loading: "Loading...",
  success: "Loaded successfully!",
  error: "Failed to load.",
});
```
* Accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, screen reader support).

### Added

* Initial release of **Toastware** ðŸŽ‰
